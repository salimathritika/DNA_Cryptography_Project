DNA Cryptography Project

This project implements DNA-based encryption and decryption algorithms, incorporating elements inspired by biological processes like transcription, translation, and XOR operations on DNA sequences. This secure data exchange system uses RSA for public-key encryption to securely transfer symmetric keys, while employing a client-server model with a graphical interface.

Project Structure

Main Components
- Server (server_gui.py): Receives and decrypts DNA-encrypted messages.
- Client (client_gui.py): Encrypts plaintext messages and sends them to the server.
- DNA Encoding and Decryption:
  - dna_encrypt.py: Encrypts messages by converting them to DNA sequences, applying XOR-based encryption, and adding "introns" for added security.
  - dna_decrypt.py: Decrypts encrypted DNA sequences by reversing transcription, removing introns, and applying XOR decryption.
  - dna_encoding.py: Encodes characters into DNA sequences and decodes them back.
- Key Management:
  - key_generation.py: Dynamically generates symmetric keys based on DNA sequence length.
- Biological Processes:
  - biological_processes.py: Simulates biological operations including transcription (DNA to mRNA), translation (mRNA to tRNA), and reverse transcription (mRNA back to DNA).

Directory Structure
- server_gui.py - Server-side GUI for receiving messages.
- client_gui.py - Client-side GUI for sending encrypted messages.
- dna_encoding.py - DNA encoding/decoding tables and functions.
- dna_encrypt.py - DNA encryption process with XOR and biological transformations.
- dna_decrypt.py - DNA decryption process to retrieve original messages.
- key_generation.py - Dynamic key generation based on DNA sequence requirements.
- biological_processes.py - Handles transcription, translation, and reverse transcription.

Features and Workflow

1. Key Generation: RSA public-private key pairs are generated by the server for secure symmetric key exchange.
2. Symmetric Key Exchange: Client encrypts the symmetric key with the server's public key for secure transmission.
3. DNA Encryption:
   - Plaintext is encoded to DNA sequences using dna_encoding.py.
   - XOR encryption is applied with a symmetric key (dna_encrypt.py).
   - Transcription converts the DNA to mRNA, replacing thymine (T) with uracil (U) to simulate biological processes.
   - Translation creates a complementary tRNA sequence from the mRNA.
   - Introns are inserted into the DNA sequence to obfuscate the encrypted data.
4. DNA Decryption:
   - Server removes introns and reverses transcription to convert mRNA back to DNA (dna_decrypt.py).
   - The XOR decryption retrieves the encoded DNA message, which is then decoded back to plaintext.


Running the Application

1. Start the Server  
   Run the server to wait for client connections:
   python server_gui.py
   

2. Start the Client 
   Connect to the server and send encrypted messages:
   python client_gui.py


3. Sending a Message  
   - In the Client GUI, input the plaintext message.
   - Click “Send Encrypted Message.” The message will be DNA-encrypted and transmitted to the server.
   - The server will decrypt the message and display it in the server GUI.

Encryption Details

- Encoding Table: Uses dna_encoding.py to convert plaintext characters to DNA sequences.
- XOR Operation: dna_encrypt.py and dna_decrypt.py use XOR tables to securely alter DNA sequences.
- Transcription & Translation: 
  - Transcription: Converts DNA sequences to mRNA by replacing T with U.
  - Translation: Creates complementary tRNA sequences from the mRNA.
  - Reverse Transcription: Converts mRNA back to DNA by replacing U with T.
- Introns: Random introns are inserted in the encryption phase to obfuscate data.

Technologies Used

- Python: Core language for the application.
- PyCryptodome: Provides RSA encryption for secure key exchange.
- Tkinter: GUI framework for server-client interfaces.
